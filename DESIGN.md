# DESIGN.md: Awesome SysML V2

## Product

**Name:** Awesome SysML V2  
**Purpose:** Public-domain curated index of SysML v2 specifications, official implementations, editors and tooling, parsers and SDKs, validation, models and case studies, learning material, deployment artifacts, commercial tools, and v1 migration paths.  
**Primary users:** Systems engineers and MBSE practitioners.  
**Primary actions:** Scan section index, open an upstream resource, open the full README list, suggest a resource or report a dead link.  
**Surface:** One GitHub Pages landing (`docs/index.html` path family) with in-page anchors. README on GitHub stays the canonical deep list unless a later pass mirrors entries under this contract without drift.

## Design Direction

- **Primary style:** minimal-technical  
- **Secondary influence:** none (cool technical system only; no warm SaaS token blend)  
- **Reference influences:** Vercel (restraint, mono metadata, one claim per viewport), Primer (dense functional UI, tag/state colour), Linear (type-led hierarchy and short motion on a **light** shell only)  
- **Impression constraints:** credible, precise, quiet, dense-tolerant, navigable  
- **Patterns:** progressive-disclosure (section summary then depth via anchors); light homepage-composition for top argument order only  
- **Override note:** none; documentation router row holds  
- **Avoid:** gradient heroes, glass, emoji chrome, violet/indigo defaults, three equal feature cards, stock photos, multi-hue tags, centre-everything, unthemed shadcn defaults, CDN fonts, accordion-hiding the list

## Design Principles

1. **The list is the product.** Chrome exists to route attention to sections and links, never to perform brand theatre.  
2. **One accent, everywhere.** Interactive and live states only; tags stay neutral chips with mono labels.  
3. **Depth without traps.** Summaries first, stable anchors for deep content; never hide the catalogue behind hover or forced accordions.

## Colour System

Derived inside minimal-technical ranges (cool neutrals, accent hue 250-256). Concrete tokens:

```css
--color-bg: oklch(0.985 0.006 255);
--color-surface-1: oklch(0.995 0.005 255);
--color-surface-2: oklch(0.998 0.004 255);
--color-surface-3: oklch(1.0 0 0);
--color-primary: oklch(0.19 0.015 260);
--color-accent: oklch(0.58 0.17 253);
--color-text: oklch(0.17 0.012 258);
--color-text-muted: oklch(0.50 0.012 258);
--color-border: oklch(0.915 0.008 255);
--color-focus-ring: var(--color-accent);
--color-success: oklch(0.45 0.10 150);
--color-danger: oklch(0.50 0.14 25);
--color-attention: oklch(0.55 0.12 85);
```

**Derivation notes:** bg/surfaces stay near-white with cool 255 hue so the page reads as one system. Primary and text are near-black ink (no coloured headings). Accent is a single blue at hue 253 inside 250-256, reserved for links, focus, active nav, and the primary CTA border/fill. Semantic colours are functional only (issue/success states), not decoration. Tag chips use surface-1 + border + muted text; never per-tag rainbow hues.

## Typography

- **Display/body:** IBM Plex Sans (self-hosted under `docs/fonts/`; no CDN)  
- **Monospace:** IBM Plex Mono for versions, dates, tags, slugs, entry metadata  
- **Scale (1.25 from 16px):** 12.8 (meta), 16 (body), 20 (h3), 25 (h2), 31 (h1)  
- **Weights:** 400 body, 500 labels/emphasis/entry titles, 600 section headings  
- **Rules:** Headings distinguished by weight and size, never by colour alone. Prose measure 65-75ch. Tabular nums for counts and years where aligned.

## Layout

- Content max width **1120px**; prose blocks clamp to ~70ch inside that shell  
- **12-column** mental grid; section index as compact linked grid or two-column list (5/7 or full-width stacked on mobile), not centred card deck  
- Spacing scale: 4 / 8 / 16 / 32 / 56 (xl). Major sections separated by **64-96px**  
- Density high inside entry blocks; dividers are 1px border, not cards  
- Optional sticky top nav; no fixed multi-panel app chrome for the pilot

## Shape Language

- Radius: sm **3px**, md **5px**, lg **7px**  
- Hairline borders (`1px solid var(--color-border)`)  
- Elevation: none by default; at most one soft shadow on the primary CTA if needed  
- Dividers separate entries; avoid boxed card stacks

## Components

| Need | Source |
|---|---|
| Page shell, nav, footer | Custom, tokens above (seed from family Path S landing; restyle to this contract) |
| Primary/secondary buttons | Custom button styles mapped to primary/accent; if shadcn Button is introduced later, retheme every token before ship |
| Section index links | Custom anchor list; Primer density as reference only |
| Entry rows | Custom: title link + mono tag chips + year; changelog-style gutter optional for sweep metadata |
| Tags/chips | Custom neutral chips (surface-1, border, mono 12.8px) |
| Disclosure | Native `<details>` or visible "Show more" only for optional secondary copy; section bodies stay open by default |
| Icons | lucide-react only if an app shell appears later; pilot prefers text and CSS, one family if icons appear |

Registry order respected: reuse project HTML first; shadcn only if a later app path needs primitives, with mandatory token override.

## Motion

- Philosophy: state change only; motion is felt, not featured  
- Duration **120-200ms**, easing ease-out  
- Properties: opacity and 4-8px translate only  
- Hover: colour/underline on links; no scale, no parallax, no bounce  
- `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` disables animation and transition

## Imagery

- No stock photography. No abstract AI gradients  
- Optional: simple monochrome SysML-adjacent diagram only if it earns space; default is typography + list  
- Icons sparse; mono text labels preferred  
- Open Graph: title + description; existing social-card.png may remain as optional share image

## Responsive Behaviour

- **Desktop (≥1024px):** full section index density; optional two-column index  
- **Tablet:** single column; nav collapses to wrap or simple horizontal scroll of anchor links  
- **Mobile (390px target):** stacked hero, full-width CTA (≥44px tall), section anchors as stacked list, no horizontal overflow, body still ≥16px

## Accessibility

- Body text and muted text meet WCAG AA on bg/surfaces  
- Visible `:focus-visible` ring using accent (2px, offset 2px) on every interactive control  
- Keyboard: all nav anchors, CTAs, and issue links operable; disclosure keyboard-friendly if used  
- Touch targets ≥44px on primary actions  
- `lang="en"`; semantic landmarks (`header`, `main`, `nav`, `footer`); heading order h1→h2→h3  
- Reduced motion respected as above

## Component Sources

1. Existing project landing HTML/CSS and family Path S seed  
2. shadcn/ui only on a future app path, rethemed  
3. No Aceternity/Magic marketing kits on this list product  
4. Custom last for entry rows and section index

## Anti-patterns

From generic-ai-ui plus project rules:

- Centred indigo/violet gradient hero  
- Inter/Roboto as the only font  
- Three identical feature cards  
- Glassmorphism and glow  
- Oversized radii outside 3/5/7  
- Generic "transform your workflow" copy  
- Rainbow tags; emoji in chrome  
- CDN font hotlink  
- Dark Linear shell on this light long-read brief

## Reference Sites

1. https://vercel.com: mono metadata, contrast, one CTA per viewport  
2. https://primer.style: dense functional hierarchy for chips and lists  
3. https://linear.app: type weight hierarchy and short motion (light adaptation only)

## Quality Bar

Must feel like a careful technical index from a competent maintainer.  
Must not feel like: a default Tailwind marketing page, an AI template, a generic dashboard theme, or a SaaS launch landing.

**Pilot composition order:** nav → hero (claim + one primary CTA) → evidence strip (v0.1.0, last sweep 2026-09, entry count, text-only family pointer) → section index (primary) → short curation note → contribute links → footer (CC0, licence enquiry, maintainer).

**Implementation note (not style):** Path S static `docs/` with self-hosted Plex is the intended first build; Path N Next export is deferred until a spoke needs app components. Superpowers process owns implementation later.

- styles/minimal-technical ranges mirrored from that sample
- patterns: progressive-disclosure; homepage-composition capped to hero + evidence + index
